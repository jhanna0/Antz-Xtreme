- improve NPC source logic -> does it move to different area?
- need to randomly generate source/machine/item locations -> next
- need a map to have list of items we can generate
- config file that creates relationship between worth/cost of sources, items, purchases so play is smoother
- globally implement speed which effects tick rate etc
- possible winning - build up to final item goal full inv? like 2048 but full inv. combined craft
