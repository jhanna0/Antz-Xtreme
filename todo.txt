- need to map items better than their ascii symbol
- need a way for npcs to know which sources they should be handling so they all don't go for same sources
- need to randomly generate source/machine/item locations
- need a map to have list of items we can generate
- config file that creates relationship between worth/cost of sources, items, purchases so play is smoother
- definitely move both NPC and player interactions to the manager files... not the character files I don't think
- fix multiple purchases at shop
